Autumn olive,"Autumn olive is a deciduous shrub or small tree. Native to China, Japan and Korea, it was introduced to North America in the 1830s and has since become established."
Giant hogweed,"Giant hogweed is an extremely invasive species that originated from Asia and Eastern Europe. It is a perennial and a member of the carrot and parsley family. Giant hogweed can pose a serious health hazard for humans. If the plant’s watery, clear sap comes into contact with human skin and is then exposed to sunlight, the UV radiation can cause severe burning and weeping blisters."
Wild parsnip,"Wild parsnip is a member of the carrot/parsley family that is recognizable by its white flowers. The plants grow wild along roadsides and other unmaintained areas, and produce yellow flowers that appear similar in shape to those of Queen Anne’s Lace. This plant is usually found in abandoned fields, meadows, yards, roadsides, railways and trails with moist to dry soils. The plant sap contains chemicals that can cause severe burns to eyes and skin."
Salt-cedar,"Salt-cedar (commonly known as “pink cascade” and tamarisk) has been identified as an invasive alien species by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency, named as one of The Nature Conservancy’s (U.S.) dirty dozen weeds and listed as one of the World Conservation Union’s 100 worst invaders."
Policeman's helmet,"Himalayan balsam, commonly known as policeman’s helmet, is an invasive alien species threatening wetlands throughout much of the northern hemisphere. While native to the Himalayas, this plant spreads aggressively along riverbanks."
Garlic mustard,"Brought to North America by early colonists, this invasive alien plant is now spreading across the continent at a rate of 6,400 square kilometres per year — that's an area 10 times the size of Toronto."
Woodland angelica,"Woodland angelica may seem quite similar to queen-Anne's lace, but beware: it's actually a member of the celery family and a serious invader of wooded edges and moist open areas in New Brunswick."
Dog-strangling vine,"European swallow-wort, most commonly known as dog-strangling vine, is a member of the milkweed family. Despite its name, it doesn't pose any real threat to dogs. Unfortunately, it does pose a significant risk to native plants and habitats."
Japanese barberry,"Japanese barberry is an invasive shrub that is native to Japan and was introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant in 1875. The plant is a compact woody deciduous shrub with arching branches."
Yellow flag iris,"While it can be an attractive perennial often sold in nurseries, the yellow flag iris is an invasive species that poses a great threat to fragile wetland ecosystems such as Baikie. Unless tackled early, the iris can rapidly form dense cover, preventing the establishment of native wetland plants, which in turn can support far more native animal species. This flower is native to Europe, western Asian and northwest Africa."
Reed meadow grass,"Reed meadow grass is a wetland grass that was introduced in the 1940s as a forage plant that could be planted in wet pasture areas for cattle in North America. It subsequently spread throughout Ontario, where it is has overtaken native cattails and other species."
Common reed,"Common reed is a large perennial grass that grows up to five metres tall. Although it grows in all wetlands, it is often found growing in roadside ditches."
Scotch broom,"Scotch broom is a perennial shrub originally from Europe. Introduced as an ornamental plant in the mid-19th century, it is now the poster child of invasive species in British Columbia. According to the BC Invasive Species Council, it would seem Scotch broom was also used to pack whiskey cases for gold camps along the west coast. Once the packing material was discarded, this allowed the spread of the plant even further. Scotch broom was also used for many years as a means of preventing soil erosion along roadsides."
Glossy buckthorn,"Glossy buckthorn is a non-native tree that was introduced to Canada from Eurasia approximately 100 years ago. It can grow as tall as seven metres. Once used for landscaping, this tree has now become an invasive species."
Leafy spurge,"Native to central and southern Europe, leafy spurge is believed to have been transported to North America in the early 19th century, then spread across western Canada. The plant was first recorded in Alberta in 1933 and in Saskatchewan shortly thereafter. By 2005 the Saskatchewan Ministry of Agriculture estimated more than 20,000 acres (8,094 hectares) in Saskatchewan had been infested with leafy spurge."
European buckthorn,"European buckthorn is native to Eurasia. It was introduced to North America as an ornamental shrub for fencerows and wildlife habitat. This invasive alien species is found in Manitoba and is a large problem in natural areas in Winnipeg."
Purple loosestrife,"Purple loosestrife is a wetland plant native to Europe and Asia that was brought to North America the early 19th century. This highly invasive plant was likely introduced when its seeds were included in soil used as ballast in European sailing ships and discarded in North America. The plant was also spread by early settlers and is still used in flower gardens and occasionally sold in nurseries today."
