"Giant hogweed","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/giant-hogweed.html","Giant hogweed is an extremely invasive species that originated from Asia and Eastern Europe. It is a perennial and a member of the carrot and parsley family. Giant hogweed can pose a serious health hazard for humans. If the plant’s watery, clear sap comes into contact with human skin and is then exposed to sunlight, the UV radiation can cause severe burning and weeping blisters.","","",
"Autumn olive","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/autumn-olive.html","Autumn olive is a deciduous shrub or small tree. Native to China, Japan and Korea, it was introduced to North America in the 1830s and has since become established.","","",
"Wild parsnip","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/wild-parsnip.html","Wild parsnip is a member of the carrot/parsley family that is recognizable by its white flowers. The plants grow wild along roadsides and other unmaintained areas, and produce yellow flowers that appear similar in shape to those of Queen Anne’s Lace. This plant is usually found in abandoned fields, meadows, yards, roadsides, railways and trails with moist to dry soils. The plant sap contains chemicals that can cause severe burns to eyes and skin.","3","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/index.jsp?page=3",

"Garlic mustard","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/garlic_mustard.html","Brought to North America by early colonists, this invasive alien plant is now spreading across the continent at a rate of 6,400 square kilometres per year — that's an area 10 times the size of Toronto.","","",
"Woodland angelica","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/woodland-angelica.html","Woodland angelica may seem quite similar to queen-Anne's lace, but beware: it's actually a member of the celery family and a serious invader of wooded edges and moist open areas in New Brunswick.","3","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/index.jsp?page=3",
"Dog-strangling vine","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/dog-strangling_vine.html","European swallow-wort, most commonly known as dog-strangling vine, is a member of the milkweed family. Despite its name, it doesn't pose any real threat to dogs. Unfortunately, it does pose a significant risk to native plants and habitats.","","",
"Japanese barberry","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/japanese-barberry.html","Japanese barberry is an invasive shrub that is native to Japan and was introduced to the United States as an ornamental plant in 1875.

"Yellow flag iris","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/yellow-flag-iris.html","While it can be an attractive perennial often sold in nurseries, the yellow flag iris is an invasive species that poses a great threat to fragile wetland ecosystems such as Baikie. Unless tackled early, the iris can rapidly form dense cover, preventing the establishment of native wetland plants, which in turn can support far more native animal species. This flower is native to Europe, western Asian and northwest Africa.","3","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/index.jsp?page=3",

"Scotch broom","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/scotch-broom.html","Scotch broom is a perennial shrub originally from Europe. Introduced as an ornamental plant in the mid-19th century, it is now the poster child of invasive species in British Columbia. According to the BC Invasive Species Council, it would seem Scotch broom was also used to pack whiskey cases for gold camps along the west coast. Once the packing material was discarded, this allowed the spread of the plant even further. Scotch broom was also used for many years as a means of preventing soil erosion along roadsides.","2","http://www.natureconservancy.ca/en/what-we-do/resource-centre/invasive-species/index.jsp?page=2",
